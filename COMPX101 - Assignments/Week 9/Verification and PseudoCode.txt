What are the benefits of using arrays?
	Speed, if fixed number of elements, arrays are efficient.

If you wanted to store the name and age of 100 people what variables would
you declare to store this information? Explain your answer.

	If the number of people is fixed at 100, then:

	declare an string array for names of size 100,
	declare an integer array for ages of size 100,

	If the number of elements can change and should be dynamic a list would be better.
